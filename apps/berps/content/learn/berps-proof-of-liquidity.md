# Berps & Proof Of Liquidity

[Proof-of-Liquidity](https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-liquidity) (PoL) is Berachain's unique consensus mechanism, which revolves around the idea that putting liquidity to work is rewarded.

Berps is a native dApp in the Berachain ecosystem that supports (PoL) by being one of a few dApps that are whitelisted to receive rewards in the form of [Berachain Governance Token](/learn/tokens/bgt) ($BGT).

In Berachain, a dApp is whitelisted whenever a Rewards Vault address is added as an option for Validators to choose to direct their `$BGT` emissions to.

More addresses can be whitelisted as Rewards Vaults, as long as they are approved through governance.

## Berps bHoney Vault & `$BGT`

To qualify for earning `$BGT` with Berps, a user would need to deposit `$HONEY` into the Berps `$bHoney` Vault, which allows traders to create leveraged trades. Users will receive `$bHONEY` for their `$HONEY` deposit and can stake their `$bHONEY` to earn `$BGT`.

How much `$BGT` a `$bHONEY` staker earns over time is dependent on whenever a validator distributes emission to Berps and that validator's contribution percentage defined in their distribution contract _Berachef_.

In addition to any profits that would come for contributing to the vault in the form of `$HONEY` and staking the `$bHONEY` received, a staker can earn `$BGT` over time whenever a validator distributes emission to Berps and is divided by contribution percentage.

Withdrawing staked `$HONEY` requires a waiting period of [1-3 epochs](#bhoney-vault), and requires burning your `$bHONEY` in the process of withdrawing.

## What Can You Do With $BGT?

![Berps & BGT Uses](/assets/berps-bgt-uses.png)

`$BGT` is used to delegate to validators to increase their weight for receiving `$BGT` rewards, can be burned for `$BERA`, or used for governance voting and proposals.

As a Berps vault staker, it would be advantageous to delegate `$BGT` to a validator that is already directing emissions to Berps to increase the `$BGT` rewards that vault staker would receive.
